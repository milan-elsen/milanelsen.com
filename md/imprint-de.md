### Liability for content
As a service provider we are responsible according to ยง 7 Abs.1 TMG for our own contents on this website according to the general laws. We do not provide third party content.
Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the moment of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of appropriate violations, we will remove this content immediately.

### Liability for links
Our website and mobile applications contains links to external websites of third parties over whose contents we have no influence. Please note that the use of such third party sites or content is subject to the privacy policies and usage terms of the third party in question instead of our own terms. Therefore we can not assume any liability for these external contents. The content of the linked pages is always the responsibility of the respective provider or operator of the pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognisable at the time of linking.
However, a permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of law. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.
